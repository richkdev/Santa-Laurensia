        <div>
            <h2>Eagle Bird</h2>
            <p>The flying Eagle symbolizes the world traveler who is courageous and strong while persevering in
                achieving one&CloseCurlyQuote;s goals. This symbol embodies the character of our students, who are both
                independently driven yet globally concerned as well as people of integrity, competency, and faith.</p>
        </div>

    <section id="cross_star">
        <div>
            <h2>Cross Shaped Star</h2>
            <p>This symbol has two essential parts that reflect the moral character of our students. First, the cross
                symbolizes the struggle and the sacrifice of Jesus Christ to save mankind from sin. It also symbolizes
                the victory over self-centeredness, which is not in harmony with the will of God. As a Roman Catholic
                school, Santa Laurensia School advances a reverence and acceptance of the redemption of Jesus Christ by
                building foundational character traits that align with integrity, competence, and faith. Students act
                upon these foundational principles in service to others. Next, the star symbolizes the Holy Spirit -
                God&CloseCurlyQuote;s guiding force that strengthens our students to act wisely and directly with
                integrity.

            <h2>MOTTO</h2>
            <q><i>Educatio puerilis renovatio mundi est.</i></q>
            <pre>( The education of the young transforms the world. )</pre>
            <p>Santa Laurensia School educates students to develop as whole persons who are motivated to make a
                positive, innovative contribution to regional, national, and international communities. Teachers and
                staff of Santa Laurensia School approach our students with the following ideas in mind:
            </p>
            <div class="box">
                <ol>
                    <li><u><b>Student-Centeredness.</b></u> Teaching is centered on the interest and abilities of
                        students so that
                        they develop fully. Teachers provide a meaningful educational platform where students can
                        explore their world on their terms.</li>
                    <li><u><b>Respect for the Individual.</b></u> Teachers interact with students respectfully and with
                        care as
                        unique
                        individuals with unlimited potential.
                        Teachers as Motivators. Teachers choose topics that are both interesting to students as
                        well as
                        age-appropriate for them, thereby encouraging them to excel in personally relevant ways.
                    </li>
                    <li><u><b>Teachers and Staff are Fair-Minded.</b></u> Teachers and Staff at Santa Laurensia School
                        do their level
                        best to find amicable ways of resolving student conflicts both in and out of class. In
                        interacting with students, we show love and encouragement to students. We also treat students
                        equally, without racial, religious, or social bias.</li>
                    <li><u><b>Teaching Based on Life-Long Learning.</b></u> Teachers create unit plans that initially
                        consider
                        long-term learning objectives, asking questions such as, “What do I want these students
                        to
                        remember about this topic 30 years from now?” Next, they determine what kinds of
                        assessments
                        show student achievement in those key areas. Finally, teachers create meaningful,
                        interactive
                        lessons that are topically relevant and academically sound so that students engage with
                        learning
                        material eagerly.</li>
                    <li><u><b>Teachers and Staff with Community Mindedness.</b></u> Although many of the staff and
                        teachers are
                        international, all strive to remain sensitive to Indonesian cultural norms of
                        interaction both in and out of the classroom. This also carries over into their
                        interactions within the greater community.</li>
                    <li><u><b>Teachers and Staff as Lifelong Learners.</b></u> Teachers and staff receive ongoing
                        training in
                        the most
                        up-to-date teaching methodologies as part of the School’s commitment to professional
                        development. Teachers and staff are encouraged to explore these delivery techniques in classroom
                        settings to test their veracity and viability. Therefore, teachers and staff “practice what they
                        preach” in terms of their own professional commitment to excellence.</li>
